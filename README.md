# Sports Team Tracker

### What will the application do?

The application I am creating is called the **Team Tracker** which  
will help sports teams keep track of their progress, as well as  
players' progress. For example, the tracker will keep statistics  
for each player, as well as the overall statistics of the team.  
Some other functions of the application will be upcoming games,  
standings or the team, and being able to select which sport is being played.

### Who will use it?

This application is targeted towards managers of minor sports
teams. The players and parents of the team may be interested in   
the stats they are producing, and this application will be of use  
in this situation.

### Why is this project of interest to you?

I am interested in this project because I used to play on a rep  
hockey team when I was younger. I always wanted there to be an   
easy way to keep track of my teammates' and my stats, but we  
not have an application to do this. I am creating this because  
I know it is something my younger self would have wanted.
