# Sports Team Tracker

### What will the application do?

The application I am creating is called the **Team Tracker** which  
will help sports teams keep track of their progress, as well as  
players' progress. For example, the tracker will keep statistics  
for each player, as well as the overall statistics of the team.  
Some other functions of the application will be upcoming  
games, standings or the team, and being able to select which sport is being played.

### Who will use it?

This application is targeted towards managers of minor sports
teams. The players and parents of the team may be interested 
in stats they are producing, and this application will be of use  
in this situation.

### Why is this project of interest to you?

I am interested in this project because I used to play on a rep  
hockey team when I was younger. I always wanted there to be  
an easy way to keep track of my teammates' and my stats, but  
we not have an application to do this. I am creating this  
because I know it is something my younger self would have wanted.

### User Stories
- Create a new team and add it to a list of teams
- Create a player and add it to a team
- View list of teams and list of players
- Edit amount of goals and assists scored by a player
- Save list of teams to a file
- Load list of teams from a file

### Phase 4: Task 2

Here is an example of a series of events that is displayed after the   
application closes:

Team Raptors added to ListOfTeams.   
Team Leafs added to ListOfTeams.    
Person Pascal Siakam added to Raptors.   
Person Fred Vanvleet added to Raptors.   
Person Auston Matthews added to Leafs.   
Person Mitch Marner added to Leafs.

### Phase 4: Task 3

Here are some changes I would make to my project if I had more time: 

- Have only one frame most of the time, instead of opening a new frame every time a button is clicked
- Have a back button for this one frame, so it is still easy to navigate through the application
- Instead of adding goals/assists by typing a number into a text field, I would have (+) and (-) buttons
- Add a new page when a player is clicked, so the user can see all of their info, including name, goals and assists
- Add more information of the team page, showing the sport, as I did not really make use of the sport variable
- Add more sports related pictures so that it is a more immersive experience
